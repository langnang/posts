## Data Structures

### Basic Data Structures

- **Arrays** are static data structures that store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists** are dynamic data structures that store elements in individual nodes, with each node pointing to the next.
- **Stacks** follow the Last-In-First-Out principle (LIFO) and primarily assist in function calls in most programming languages.
- **Queues** operate on the First-In-First-Out principle (FIFO) and are commonly used in task scheduling.
- **Hash Tables** store key-value pairs allowing for fast insertion, deletion, and search operations.
